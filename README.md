# Data Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of data analytics projects I've completed through coursework at the Harris School of Public Policy and through Dataquest. The projects are presented in Jupyter Notebooks.

## [2020 and 2022 Georgia Absentee Rejection Data Analysis](https://github.com/Shanelks/Shanel_Singh_Projects/blob/main/GA%20AB%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
Voter suppression has been on the rise over the past decade, specifically targeting Absentee Voting. Georgia has been central in the fight against voter suppression. In this exploratory research project, I aimed to analyze Absentee Application and Ballot Rejections from the past two General Elections through data provided from the GA Secretary of State. In this project, I visualize the distribution of rejections on a county-level and run a OLS regression between the application and ballot rejections with Census data. Please note that I last downloaded the 2022 data on 11/13,  since then the numbers have been updated and the election results resulted in a runoff.
